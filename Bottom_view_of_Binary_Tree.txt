Question.) --> Bottom view of Binary Tree
You are given the root of a binary tree, and your task is to return its bottom view. The bottom view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the bottom.

Note: If there are multiple bottom-most nodes for a horizontal distance from the root, then the latter one in the level order traversal is considered.

/*
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};

  public:
    vector<int> bottomView(Node *root) {
        // code here
        vector<int> res;
        queue<pair<Node*, int>> q;
        map<int, int> mp;
        
        q.push({root, 0});
        while(!q.empty()){
            Node* curr = q.front().first;
            int currHD = q.front().second;
            
            q.pop();
            
            if(mp.find(currHD) == mp.end()){
                mp[currHD] = curr->data;
            }
            else{
                mp[currHD] = curr->data;
            }
            
            if(curr->left != NULL){
                q.push({curr->left, currHD-1});
            }
            
            if(curr->right != NULL){
                q.push({curr->right, currHD+1});
            }
        }
        
        for(auto i:mp){
            res.push_back(i.second);

    }
};


In this I used one queue which track all the nodes of the linked list and position which are in the pair (This will be done in Level order Traversal).
Now, I will make a new map in which position of Node is stored.
Then, I will check it by apply the condition of current Horizontal distance of element if is directly upper to the Node then we neglect it other wise we store in our. So we get our final result.
