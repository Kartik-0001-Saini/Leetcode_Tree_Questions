Question 236.) --> Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

solution.)-->
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if(root == NULL){
            return NULL;
        }

        if(root == p || root == q){
            return root;
        }

        TreeNode* leftLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* rightLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

        if(leftLCA && rightLCA){
            return root;
        }

        else if(leftLCA != NULL){
            return leftLCA;
        }

        else{
            return rightLCA;
        }
    }
};

In this question we are going to each node and find a node. If we find any one node then we have to return that particular node to root node so it will return it.
Similar in other case.

Time Complexity :- O(n)
Space Complexity :- O(n)
