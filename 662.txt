Question 662.) Maximum width of Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

I make a queue consist of Node and integer in pair.
Why i take unsigned long long variable?
Because node may go upto 3000 in question as i am strong this in variable. It not possible to store it in integer format.

        while(q.size() > 0){
            int currLevel = q.size();
            unsigned long long stIdx = q.front().second;
            unsigned long long endIdx = q.back().second;

            maxWidth = max(maxWidth, (endIdx - stIdx +1));

            for(int i=0; i<currLevel; i++){
                auto curr = q.front();
                q.pop();

                // unsigned long long idx = curr.second - stIdx;

                if(curr.first->left){
                    q.push({curr.first->left, curr.second*2+1});
                }

                if(curr.first->right){
                    q.push({curr.first->right, curr.second*2+2});
                }
            }
        }

        return (int)maxWidth;
    }
};

Time Complexity :- O(n)
Because we are travelling whole Tree only one time.
